# TableauDashboardSmartCities
Crime in Chicago: Tableau Dashboard for Smart Cities class last year. One of the most complicated tasks was to convert the more granular data to Ward level in the map without using any scripting as a preprocessing step, joining two different datasets in QGIS and creating ward level data from SHP. Basemap layer is Open Street Maps.
